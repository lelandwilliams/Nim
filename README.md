# Nim
A program in Python3 by [Leland Williams](https://lelandwilliams.github.io/)
, as part of his Senior Thesis in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota
that implements the algorithm by [Mike Weimerskich](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~weim0024/),
as described in [his paper](http://library.msri.org/books/Book63/files/131106-Weimerskirch.pdf)

The program finds the period, preperiod, and P-positions for a given Nim ruleset 
(expressed as a quartenary code) in a given number of dimensions.
